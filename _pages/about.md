Hello! I am currently a second-year master student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), adivised by Prof. [Eric Laber](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/eblaber) and Prof. [Rebecca Steorts](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/beka). I also enjoy working with Prof. [Simon Mak](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/SimonTszFung.Mak).

Originally from China, I completed my undergraduate studies in [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) with B.Sc. in Mathematics and Data Science. Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, running, and traveling.
